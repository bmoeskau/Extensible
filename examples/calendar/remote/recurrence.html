            <h1>Recurrence Demo</h1>
            <p>This sample demonstrates the recurrence support built into Calendar Pro. It loads a
                default data set showing off some of the supported recurrence patterns, and also enables
                the recurrence editor widget in the detailed event form. To enable recurrence editing you
                simply pass <code>recurrence: true</code> to the CalendarPanel during creation.</p>
                
            <p>The meat of the implementation is actually in the back-end PHP code. Note that this is not
                intended to be production-quality code -- it is merely an example of how one might approach
                the implementation. Recurrence can be implemented in many different ways, and your chosen
                platform and tools will influence how you do it.</p>
                
            <p>The PHP code is documented inline, so make sure to check the source for details. The primary
                place to look for the recurrence processing logic is:<br><br>'remote/php/app/models/event.php'</p>
